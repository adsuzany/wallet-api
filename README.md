## Description

This project is a REST Wallet API, the main purpose is to receive events of operations into the wallet balance and get information.
Based in NestJS and using Prisma ORM.

## Business Rules

- It should be referred to as a digital wallet;
- To make the requests the user must be recorded in database (by dump);
- Must check the wallet balance;
- Must consult the statement with all the operations;
- When the user does not exist, NOT FOUND must be returned for all endpoints;
- It must carry out balance operations;
  - Adding Values;
    - Should only add values higher than $0.1;
  - Withdrawals;
    - Should only withdraw if the balance is positive;
    - Should only withdraw values higher than $0.1;
  - Entering Purchasing values;
    - If there is no balance, it becomes negative;
  - Cancellation and reversal will be treated as the same operation;
- Requests to the wallet can come from various channels;
  - Requests can be received a middleware or a webhook based on Event Listener and added to a queue for processing each event.
